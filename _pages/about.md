We divide the entire article into three parts. We provide the connection association of an article's cited articles, intelligent chatbot and visualization. The first part is the data processing, the second part is the visualization graphics we get, and the third part is the personal chatbot we created.

We have a super large csv file to store some of the citation relationships of these articles.We use a sphere and use time as the basis for latitude division, and we can get the following graph.
